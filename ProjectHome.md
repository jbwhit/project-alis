This package allows you to generate, and/or fit spectral data with user-specified absorption and emission line profiles, convolved with the instrumental resolution. ALIS uses a Levenberg-Marquardt chi-squared minimization algorithm. Some of the most commonly used built-in absorption/emission profiles include: Power-law, Broken Power-law, Gaussian, Voigt, Polynomial, and many more. It is also very straightforward for the user to implement their favourite absorption/emission profile.
