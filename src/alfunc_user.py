# Once you have created your own working function to be
# implemented in ALIS, you need to import it here. For
# example, if you create a function called 'myfunction.py'
# simply import it as follows:
#
# import myfunction

def load_user_functions():
	# If your function requires the atomic data used by ALIS,
	# you need to include the name of your function in the
	# sendatomic list: e.g. sendatomic = ['myfunc'] where
	# 'myfunc' is given by the parameter called self._idstr
	# in your function.
	sendatomic = []

	# Finally, add your new function to the following dictionary.
	# The key is simply the name you give to the parameter
	# self._idstr in your function, and the keyword arguments
	# are a call to your function Class. For example:
	# usrdict = dict({ 'myfunc'         : myfunction.MyFunc,
	#                  'another'        : another_function.Another
	#                 })
	usrdict = dict({})

	return usrdict, sendatomic
